This is basically a web project made using PHP and MYSQL. The main idea of the project is to allocate internship stations to students, 
taking their preferences and CGPA and the reducing the manual efforts. 

The project works on the principle that student having higher CGPA should beallocated the internship station first followed by lesser one. 
It provides complete internship management with an internship account for each student. The MYSQL is used to link database inorder to control 
the registration of users, adding companies by the internship administrator, etc.Both PHP and MYSQL are open source languages and thus 
run freely on other platforms.
